# Pseudo-3d-Doom-style-game

a 3d game based on the iconic doom game
it uses a Pseudo 3d mechanism (which not exactly 3d)
By this i mean it looks and works like 3d but its actually more like behaving and although the method of 3d is different it still uses standard 3d concepts such as raycasting or raytracing 
HAPPY CODING
